	This program includes two test stubs. One is menu.c, another is menufunction.c. 
	menu.c is a test stub that is non-functional, but menufunction.c is functional.

Build Procedure:
	
	You can use "make" to compile menu.c and test.c                          
	$ make

	You can use "make exp2" to compile menufunction.c test.c and linkTable.c 
	$ make exp2
	
	You can use "make run" to run test.c
	$ make run

	You can use "make clean" to clean all .o file
	$ make clean

Thank you!
